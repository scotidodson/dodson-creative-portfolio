          <p>Let's Do Something encourages users to try new things in their city and takes the hassle out of organizing the plans. The app allows users to save ideas of what they would like to do in their city, add friends, and host events. When hosting an event, the user can select up to three ideas and their guests vote on which idea sounds best. The host can end the poll at any time. Polls that have votes registered will return the winner based on vote count. Polls without votes will generate a random idea from the ideas selections. All participants are notified of the winning results.</p>
